Per-core CPU stability testing and AMD PBO Curve Optimizer tuning for Linux -- a graphical tool that stress-tests one core at a time at full single-threaded boost, optionally reads and writes per-core Curve Optimizer offsets via the AMD SMU, and includes an **automatic crash-safe tuner** that searches each core's most aggressive stable undervolt for you. A Linux counterpart to [CoreCycler](https://github.com/sp00n/corecycler) (Windows).

> **Status:** actively developed and tested on an **AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D** (Zen 4, single-CCD X3D, AM5). Other AMD Ryzen processors (Zen 2-5) should work but are less thoroughly tested; Intel CPUs are supported for stress testing only (no Curve Optimizer). Found a problem on other hardware?

## What Is This?

AMD Precision Boost Overdrive Curve Optimizer (CO) adjusts the voltage-frequency curve per core: a negative offset lowers voltage at a given frequency so the core boosts higher within its limits. Each core is different -- one may hold -30 while another is unstable past -10 -- so finding the right value needs **per-core** testing.

All-core tests (Prime95 all threads, Cinebench) cannot find this: under all-core load every core runs at lower clocks and voltages than it would alone, so a core that passes all-core can still crash when it boosts to its single-threaded peak. CoreCycler tests one core at a time at full boost, cycling through every core, and adds idle and variable-load tests because CO instability often shows up on C-state wake and load transitions, not under sustained load.

Design principles:

- **Safety first** -- CO writes go only through the SMU and are volatile (reset on reboot); BIOS PBO settings are never touched. The automatic tuner can never settle on a configuration that crashes the machine (see [Safety](#safety)).
- **Per-core, full-boost** -- one core under load at a time, the only way to expose per-core CO limits.
- **Correctness over "did not crash"** -- instability is judged by MCE events and self-checking compute workloads, not merely the absence of a crash.
- **Capability-driven** -- topology, sensors, and SMU support are probed; nothing is assumed.

## Safety

Read this before using the Curve Optimizer features. Full scope in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

- **CO writes are volatile** -- they live only in the CPU's runtime SMU state and **always reset on reboot**. There is no path to BIOS/UEFI NVRAM; a reboot fully restores your BIOS settings.
- **Your BIOS PBO settings are never modified** -- only the runtime SMU state changes, and only when you explicitly write a value.
- **Stress testing changes nothing** -- it only runs workloads pinned to cores; it writes no CO, voltage, or frequency.
- **CO is written in only two places** -- the Curve Optimizer tab (per-core, each write behind a confirmation dialog, with dry-run and backup/restore) and the Auto-Tuner. They are mutually exclusive -- the tab is locked while the tuner runs.
- **The automatic tuner is crash-safe** -- a CO write-ahead journal records every value before it is applied, CO=0 (stock) is the only floor it trusts, and a resume-crash circuit breaker forces all cores to stock and quarantines a profile that keeps crashing -- so no sequence of crashes, reboots, or resumes can loop the machine into re-crashing. See [Crash safety](docs/usage.md#crash-safety).
- **Thermal protection** -- a configurable temperature limit (default 95C) pauses testing; the tuner fails closed if no temperature sensor is readable.

## Installation

Add the flake input and enable the NixOS module:

```nix
{
  inputs.corecycler.url = "github:shgew/linux-corecycler";
}
```

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.corecycler.nixosModules.default ];

  services.corecycler = {
    enable = true;
    deviceAccessUser = "your-username";  # required -- grants MSR/SMU access without sudo
  };
}
```

The module handles the package, kernel modules (ryzen_smu and friends), udev rules, and
permissions. Or run it directly:

```bash
nix run github:shgew/linux-corecycler        # FOSS-only
nix run github:shgew/linux-corecycler#full   # with mprime (unfree)
```

Other distros (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, from source), the full module options, and backend
setup are in [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

## Usage

Launch with `corecycler`. Full telemetry and Curve Optimizer access need MSR and SMU
permissions: grant them to your user once (`deviceAccessUser` on NixOS, a udev rule and a
group elsewhere -- see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md#device-access)) and no
`sudo` is needed. `sudo corecycler` also works and stays supported.
Pick a backend and preset in the Configuration tab and click **Start Test**, or use the
**Auto-Tuner** tab to search every core's stable offset automatically. If a backend is
reported as not found, `corecycler doctor` prints where it looked and what it found. The
full guide -- manual tuning workflow, the Auto-Tuner, and reading results -- is in
[docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Development

```bash
nix develop                                   # the package's Python env + ruff and nixfmt
ruff check src                                # lint
python -m pytest -m 'not slow'                # the suite, inside nix develop
nix flake check                               # build + every check (what CI runs)
corecycler doctor                             # every external tool and how it resolved
```
