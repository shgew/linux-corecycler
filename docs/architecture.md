# Architecture

CoreCycler is a PySide6 (Qt6) desktop app. Stress tests run in a `QThread` worker; every
stress process is launched inside a kernel cgroup cpuset covering the CPUs of the core
under test (`systemd-run --scope -p AllowedCPUs=0,16`, payload lifetime bound via
`setpriv --pdeathsig`), a boundary the backend cannot widen with `sched_setaffinity`. One
supervised execution engine (`engine/execution.py`) monitors MCE during stress and idle
phases, watches for containment escapes, stalls, and thermal trips, parses backend
output, and refuses to launch when a backend's config is absent rather than letting the
tool fall back to a full-machine default. Processes run in their own process group for
clean teardown; a launch with no available cgroup mechanism is refused, never run
uncontained. The scope probe tries to widen its affinity and requires the effective
mask to remain CPU 0; merely accepting AllowedCPUs is not sufficient. Non-root
launches require [cpuset delegation](installation.md#cpu-containment).

Unreadable live kernel logs are environment faults, not empty error sets. Stress,
idle, and soak windows force a closing MCE read before issuing a verdict. Transition
loads use the same classified results and thermal policy as sustained loads.

The tuner refuses simulated SMU writes and CPU maps with offline present CPUs.
A cached offset becomes unknown before a hardware write, so failed readback cannot
suppress later restoration. Manual/memory stress and tuner actions are exclusive;
a paused tuner retains ownership until resumed or aborted, including on window close.

                     and the missing-tool prompt that records a backend's path
    style.py           Display standards: the desktop draws the widgets, this holds only the
                       colors that carry meaning, resolved against its current color scheme
  config/            Settings and test profiles (~/.config/corecycler/), plus tools.py --
                     the one resolver for every external binary (PATH is not enough)
nix/                 NixOS module + kernel-module derivations (ryzen-smu, zenpower, it87)
tests/               Pytest suite (unit, property/Hypothesis fuzz, fault-injection, hermetic GUI)
```

The backend registry (`engine/backends/__init__.py`) auto-discovers backends via the
`@register_backend` decorator -- the GUI populates combo boxes and the factory from it,
so no GUI file changes when a backend is added.

## Driver and kernel module sources

### SMU access

| Driver | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ryzen_smu (amkillam fork) | [amkillam/ryzen_smu](https://github.com/amkillam/ryzen_smu) | Zen 1-5 SMU: CO, PBO limits, boost, PM table |
| ryzen_smu (upstream) | [leogx9r/ryzen_smu](https://github.com/leogx9r/ryzen_smu) | Original (Zen 1-4 only) |

### CPU temperature and voltage

| Driver | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| zenpower5 | [mattkeenan/zenpower5](https://github.com/mattkeenan/zenpower5) | Zen 5 hwmon: temps + RAPL power (SVI3 voltage unavailable) |
| zenpower3 | [Ta180m/zenpower3](https://github.com/Ta180m/zenpower3) | Zen 1-4 hwmon: temps + SVI2 voltage/current |
| k10temp | [kernel.org (in-tree)](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hwmon/k10temp.c) | In-tree AMD temps (no voltage) |
| coretemp | [kernel.org (in-tree)](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/hwmon/coretemp.c) | In-tree Intel temps |

### Super I/O (motherboard Vcore fallback)

| Driver | Supported chips | Common boards |
|---|---|---|
| nct6683 (in-tree) | NCT6683/6686/6687 | Modern MSI (B550, B650, X570, X670) |
| nct6775 (in-tree) | NCT6775-NCT6799 | ASUS, MSI, ASRock AM5/AM4 |
| it87 (out-of-tree) | IT8625-IT8772 | Gigabyte AM5/AM4 |

Super I/O chips provide analog Vcore from the voltage regulator (world-readable, no root)
and are the automatic fallback on Zen 5 where SVI3 voltage is unsupported; the tool scans
input labels for the correct Vcore channel.
