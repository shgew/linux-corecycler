# Hardware support

Stress testing works on **any x86-64 CPU**, including Intel: per-core cycling, MCE
detection, topology detection, temperature monitoring, and every stress backend work
without the `ryzen_smu` module. Only the Curve Optimizer features (SMU read/write) are
AMD-specific.

On harvested or multi-CCD parts (5900X 6+6, 5600X 6-of-8, 9900X, ...) the SMU
addresses physical core slots, with gaps where cores are fused off. The kernel's
`/proc/cpuinfo` `core id` (decoded from the APIC ID via CPUID `Fn8000_001E`) carries
that physical, gap-preserving numbering on most machines, and the driver then derives
the slot directly (`core id % 8`, CCD from L3 topology). Some BIOS/AGESA builds
instead renumber core ids contiguously on harvested parts (reported on a 5600X,
issue #11), which hides the fused-off slots. The driver detects this: a numbering
that proves itself physical (holes, or only full 8-core CCDs) is used as-is with no
SMU traffic, while an ambiguous CCD has its **core-disable fuse** read over SMN --
the SMU's own record of which of the 8 slots exist -- and its cores map onto the
live slots in ascending order, the same order-preserving mapping the Windows tools
build from that fuse. The CO read cannot stand in for the fuse: it answers on every
in-range slot, fused-off ones included, which is what issue #11's 5600X reported
(all eight slots answered on a six-core CCD).

Reading an SMN register is a *write* of the address, so this needs write access to
`/sys/kernel/ryzen_smu_drv/smn`, which `ryzen_smu` ships root-only -- the NixOS
module grants it to the `corecycler` group alongside the mailbox files, and
[installation.md](installation.md#ryzen_smu-kernel-module) has the equivalent unit
for other distros. If the fuse cannot be read, has no verified address for the die
(the APUs and Shimada Peak), or disagrees with the OS core count, per-core CO is
disabled with an explicit reason (GUI banner, CLI stderr, tuner refuses to start)
instead of ever writing to the wrong core. Discovery is gated per generation on the
verified classic 8-slot-per-CCD layout; heterogeneous Zen 4c/5c dies (Phoenix2,
Strix Point, Strix Halo) keep the legacy core-id addressing untouched.

All CO-capable generations support PBO scalar read/write (1.0x to 10.0x) and OC
mode enable/disable through their own command dialect; on APUs the PPT/TDC/EDC
columns map to the APU limit block (SetSlowLimit as the sustained-PPT analogue,
TDC/EDC-VDD, SetTctlMax). SMU features require the
[ryzen_smu](https://github.com/amkillam/ryzen_smu) kernel module (amkillam fork) and
root or appropriate sysfs permissions.

| Zen 5 / 5D | Yes | Full | -50 to +10 |
| Intel | Yes | No | -- |

## Curve Shaper (Zen 5)

Curve Shaper is a Zen 5 feature that adjusts voltage across 5 frequency regions and 3
temperature points (15 tuning parameters total), stacking on top of Curve Optimizer
offsets. **Curve Shaper is BIOS-only** -- there are no known SMU commands to read or
write it at runtime, so this tool cannot interact with it. Configure Curve Shaper in
your BIOS alongside CO, then use this tool to validate the combined result.

## PBO Boost Override and BCLK

This tool imposes no artificial limits on boost clocks. A BIOS PBO Boost Override of
+200 MHz is respected; a BCLK of 105 MHz or higher (AM5) scales the effective clocks
and the tool adapts. System-state detection reads the actual max frequency from
`cpufreq` sysfs.
