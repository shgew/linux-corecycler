# Usage guide

## Quick start

1. Launch CoreCycler (`corecycler` or `python src/corecycler/main.py`). Full monitoring
   (clock stretch, per-core power, Curve Optimizer) needs access to the MSR and SMU
   devices: grant it to your user once ([Device access](installation.md#device-access))
   or launch with `sudo`. Without either it runs with reduced telemetry and a status-bar
   warning.
2. The CPU topology (cores, CCDs, SMT, X3D) is detected automatically.
3. In the Configuration tab, select a backend -- use stress-ng if mprime is not
   installed. A backend that is not on PATH (mprime and y-cruncher are extracted
   tarballs, and `sudo` drops your shell's PATH) is not a dead end: CoreCycler offers
   any copy it finds and remembers the one you pick. `corecycler doctor` shows every
   tool and where it resolved from.
4. The default preset is **Standard** (10 min/core, 1 cycle); adjust or pick another.
5. Click **Start Test** and watch the core grid: each core lights up as it is tested,
   turning green (passed) or red (failed). The Results tab shows per-core detail.

### Test mode presets

| Preset | Time/Core | Cycles | Variable Load | Idle Test | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quick | 2 min | 1 | No | No | Fast screening, rough check |
| Standard | 10 min | 1 | No | No | Initial CO tuning |
| Thorough | 30 min | 2 | No | 5s between | Validation after tuning |
| Full Spectrum | 20 min | 3 | Yes | 60s + 10s between | Comprehensive stability proof |
| Custom | User-defined | User-defined | Optional | Optional | Fine-tuned testing |

## Finding optimal CO values (manual)

The manual workflow for tuning AMD PBO Curve Optimizer:

1. **Set conservative starting CO values in BIOS** (e.g. -15 all-core) -- your baseline.
2. **Run a screening pass**: mprime, SSE, Small FFTs, Standard preset
   (~`10 min x core_count`).
3. **Identify failing cores** -- those that cannot sustain -15 at full single-threaded
   boost.
4. **Reduce CO for failing cores** in BIOS (e.g. -15 to -10, or less); leave passing
   cores at -15.
5. **Repeat** until all cores pass.
6. **Extended validation**: switch to Thorough or Full Spectrum -- the variable-load and
   idle tests catch instability sustained load misses.
7. **Test other instruction sets**: SSE produces the highest clocks and is most
   sensitive; AVX2 exercises different execution units and can expose other failures.

The **Auto-Tuner** (below) automates this whole loop via runtime SMU writes, with no
per-step reboots.

## Curve Optimizer tab

Direct SMU access for reading and writing per-core CO offsets at runtime (requires
`ryzen_smu`). Reads all current offsets, per-core spinboxes, per-core and bulk Apply
(each with a confirmation dialog), Reset to 0, Backup/Restore within a session, Dry Run
(logs writes without touching hardware), and Save/Load CO Profile (JSON, shared with the
Auto-Tuner's Export Profile and the History tab's "Load to CO Tab").

All values written here are **volatile** and reset on reboot; set them in BIOS to make
them permanent. For Zen 2 (no Curve Optimizer) the tab shows "Connected (no CO support)"
-- PBO limits and scalar are still accessible.

## Auto-Tuner

The Auto-Tuner automates the entire PBO Curve Optimizer search via runtime SMU writes
(requires `ryzen_smu`). For each core it runs a coarse-to-fine search:

1. **Coarse search** -- from `start_offset` (default 0), step by `coarse_step`
   (default -5) toward `max_offset`, running a short test (`search_duration`, default
   60s) per step. A pass goes more aggressive; a fail bounds the limit.
2. **Fine search** -- from the last passing coarse value, step by `fine_step`
   (default -1) toward the failure point to narrow the exact limit.
3. **Confirmation** -- a longer test (`confirm_duration`, default 300s) validates the
   best offset. On failure, a **smart backoff** finds the nearest stable offset: a quick
   pre-confirm filter (`search_duration x backoff_preconfirm_multiplier`, default 2x), a
   **midpoint jump** after `midpoint_jump_threshold` (default 3) consecutive pre-confirm
   fails, then **binary search** to the boundary. Backoff stops at the BIOS baseline
   (from `inherit_current`), not zero -- unless the baseline itself crashes, in which
   case it descends toward CO=0 (see [Crash safety](#crash-safety)).
4. **Multi-core validation** (`auto_validate`, on by default) -- after every core is
   individually confirmed, a staged sequence catches failures invisible to per-core
   testing:
   - **Stage 1 -- per-core, all offsets live**: all confirmed offsets applied, each core
     stressed in turn. Catches shared-VRM power-delivery interactions.
   - **Stage 2 -- all-core simultaneous**: one pinned stress process per core at once
     for `validate_duration` -- full package-power worst case, per-core verdicts.
   - **Stage 3 -- alternating half-core load**: half loaded, half idle, then swap
     (split by CCD when available). Catches boost-ramp voltage transients.
   - **Stage 4 -- rapid transitions** (`validate_transitions`): fast load/idle cycling
     across all cores -- catches idle-to-boost instability.
   - **Stage 5 -- per-core spectrum** (`validate_spectrum`): bursts, load transitions
     and idle watch per core with all offsets live.
   - **Stage 6 -- all-core memory load** (`validate_memory`): one memory stressor
     (stressapptest) per core at once, all offsets live -- catches CO marginality
     that only appears under memory-controller load. Skipped with a log if no memory
     stress tool is installed.
   - **Stage 7 -- real-world soak** (`validate_soak`): no synthetic load; the kernel
     error stream is watched for `soak_duration_seconds` while the machine is used
     normally. Any hardware event fails it.

   A failing core is backed off by one `fine_step`, re-proven solo, and only the failed
   stage reruns. A stall, external kill, or unattributable machine check is an
   APPARATUS fault: the step retries without a verdict (up to `max_apparatus_retries`),
   never a back-off. Any back-off marks the pass dirty -- completion requires one final
   clean pass. If a failing core reaches its baseline with real failures persisting,
   the tuner reverts everything to baseline and PAUSES with an honest message instead
   of declaring completion. A reboot mid-validation with no attributable evidence is
   recorded as an unattributed incident; repeated incidents pause for your decision.
5. **Result** -- each core gets a confirmed, cross-validated best offset. Export it as
   JSON or load it into the Curve Optimizer tab.

### CO isolation

During per-core search the **only** non-baseline offset on the CPU is the core under
test -- all others are reverted to baseline before and after each test, so a crash is
never wrongly blamed on a different core. During multi-core validation isolation is
deliberately off (all confirmed offsets are live to test interactions); on a stage
failure or a partial SMU write, all cores revert to baseline before pausing.

### Crash safety

Hard crashes are expected during CO tuning -- that is how each core's limit is found. No
sequence of crashes, reboots, SMU faults, or resumes can leave the tuner re-applying a
configuration that crashes the machine. Three mechanisms enforce this:

1. **CO write-ahead journal** -- every CO value is recorded in SQLite *before* it is
   written to the SMU, and marked "survived" only after a test completes with it
   resident. So on the next launch the exact `(core, value)` live at crash time is known
   (whether or not a test was running, and including a crash during idle, baseline
   restore, post-test revert, or multi-core validation). Every un-survived offset is
   treated as a hard crash: a fail bound is set there and the core backs off past it.
2. **CO=0 is the only safe floor** -- the one state guaranteed stable is CO=0 (stock
   voltage). Crash backoff never settles past it, and if a core's *baseline* is what
   crashed, the baseline is descended toward 0 rather than re-applied -- so an unstable
   inherited baseline is escapable, not an infinite loop.
3. **Resume-crash circuit breaker** -- consecutive crash-resumes without a passing
   non-hunt test are counted. Hunt passes, thermal stops, apparatus faults, and plain
   app restarts do not clear the counter. Finding and backing off a hunt culprit does.
   After `resume_crash_quarantine_threshold` (default 3), the tuner forces every core
   to CO=0 and marks the session `quarantined`, never resumed automatically.
   Reopening requires an explicit decision and retains only previously survived values.

An interrupted session is detected on next launch and offered for resume; resume
re-applies only journaled-safe baselines and re-engages one core at a time. A crash or
pause during validation is recoverable: on resume the tuner restores the persisted
validation cursor and continues at the exact stage and position it left off.

Reboot detection compares the session's persisted Linux boot ID with the current
boot, not configuration-save times or wall-clock changes. Older histories gain
that ID from their last narrative event; sessions without one retain the timestamp
fallback. Kernel evidence and orderly-shutdown checks refer to that exact boot,
not simply the immediately previous boot. Unreadable or unidentified forensic
history pauses before offsets are reapplied. Hardware errors at stock or on an
unmapped/unselected core also pause without blaming another core.

An ambiguous validation reboot triggers an isolated hunt, not an automatic penalty
against whichever core was under load. During endurance, the hunt replays the
interrupted workload's backend, instruction set, FFT size, thread count and load
profile, for at least the interrupted slot's duration, with other cores at stock.
A fruitless hunt does not prove the all-offsets-live profile stable; repeated
unattributed incidents remain bounded by the configured pause/quarantine limits.

Thermal Sensor are not in the panel: set them in the JSON that `corecycler tune
--config` loads. The Backoff Pre-Confirm Multiplier (2.0) and Midpoint Jump
Threshold (3) use sensible defaults and are not exposed at all.

### How each backend uses Mode and FFT Preset

**Mode** (SSE/AVX/AVX2/AVX512) and **FFT Preset** mean different things per backend:

- **mprime** -- Mode selects the torture-test instruction set and FFT Preset sets the FFT
  size range. `SSE` with Small FFTs is the most sensitive, highest-boost combination.
- **stress-ng** -- Mode selects the CPU stressor method; FFT Preset is ignored.
- **y-cruncher** -- y-cruncher has no instruction-set switch: the instruction set is fixed
  by the per-microarchitecture binary it auto-selects for your CPU. Mode instead chooses
  which of y-cruncher's component tests run (FFT Preset is ignored):
  - `SSE` -- `BKT` only (scalar-integer Basecase/Karatsuba): the lowest-power,
    highest-boost, most CO-sensitive test.
  - `AVX` -- `BKT, BBP, SFTv4, SNT, SVT` (adds the AVX compute and small in-cache tests).
  - `AVX2` / `AVX512` -- all algorithms, including the memory-bandwidth transforms
    (`FFTv4, N63, VT3`). Because y-cruncher auto-selects a supported binary, `AVX512` mode
    runs the strongest instruction set your CPU actually has and never crashes on a
    non-AVX512 chip.

### Test orderings

| Order | Strategy | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| sequential | Finish each core completely before the next | Simple, easy to follow |
| round_robin | One test per core per round | Partial results for all cores sooner |
| weakest_first | Prioritize cores closest to confirmation | Finish nearly-done cores first |
| ccd_alternating | Alternate CCDs, prioritize the CCD with fewest confirmed | Balanced thermal coverage |
| ccd_round_robin | Round-robin within each CCD, alternating CCDs | Best thermal profile -- each core cools while the other CCD is tested |

### Tips

- **mprime, Small FFTs, SSE** is the gold standard for CO testing -- highest single-core
  clocks and the most sensitive error detection (rounding checks, SUMOUT verification).
- The default `max_offset` of -50 suits Zen 4 and is Zen 5's firmware limit (a
  deeper request is clamped); Zen 3/3D are clamped to -30 automatically.
- A typical 16-core run takes ~2-4 hours plus several hours of staged validation (stages 1-7 include an all-core memory-load stage and a 30-minute real-world soak).
- If many cores fail at the starting offset, enable **abort on consecutive failures**
  (e.g. 3) -- it usually means BIOS PBO needs adjusting first.
- **Multi-core validation** is the key differentiator from manual testing: a core stable
  in isolation may fail when all cores draw power at once. If validation keeps backing
  off and restarting, the VRM may not support the aggregate profile -- reduce
  `max_offset` or test fewer cores.

During an active tuner session the config snapshot is taken at start, so mid-run UI
changes have no effect; the Curve Optimizer tab and manual Start Test are locked to
prevent SMU conflicts. Every session is saved in SQLite (config, per-core progress, and
each test result); starting a new session never deletes old ones.

## Recommended settings

| Scenario | Backend | Mode | FFT Preset | Preset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quick screening | stress-ng | SSE | -- | Quick |
| Initial CO tuning | mprime | SSE | Small | Standard |
| Thorough validation | mprime | SSE | Huge | Thorough |
| Comprehensive stability | mprime | SSE | All | Full Spectrum |
| AVX2 validation | mprime | AVX2 | Heavy | Standard |

## Understanding results

Core grid colors -- **blue**: testing now; **green**: passed/confirmed; **red**: failed;
**amber**: tuner smart-backoff; **gray**: pending; **purple**: memory stress (all cores
at once).

| Error type | Meaning | Typical cause |
|---|---|---|
| MCE (Machine Check Exception) | Hardware-level CPU error (sysfs or dmesg) | CO too aggressive -- voltage too low for the requested frequency |
| Computation | Stress test got a wrong result (rounding, sumout, mismatch) | CO too aggressive -- subtle numerical instability |
| Idle instability | MCE during an idle/C-state transition | CO unstable during voltage ramp-up from deep sleep |
| Load transition | Error during a variable-load stop/start | Voltage regulation insufficient during rapid load changes |
| Timeout | Stress process stopped responding | Possible instability hang (sometimes benign) |
| Crash | Stress process terminated unexpectedly | Core instability causing instruction faults |

**MCE errors are the most serious** -- the CPU detected an actual hardware-level error;
reduce that core's CO (make it less negative). **Computation errors** are the most common
CO-tuning failure. **Idle instability** is caught by the idle test phase and is a failure
mode sustained-load tests miss entirely.
