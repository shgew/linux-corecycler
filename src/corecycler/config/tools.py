"""External tool resolution -- the one place CoreCycler locates a binary.

PATH alone cannot find these tools. sudo replaces PATH with the sudoers
``secure_path`` on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint, Fedora and Arch, so a directory the user
added to PATH in their shell is already gone by the time CoreCycler runs as
root; a desktop launcher never sees a shell PATH at all; and mprime and
y-cruncher ship as tarballs extracted wherever the user likes, so they are
never on PATH to begin with.

Resolution order, most explicit first: the ``CORECYCLER_<TOOL>_BIN``
environment variable, the path recorded in ``tool-paths.json``, then PATH. An
explicit path that is not an executable file is REFUSED with the reason, never
silently replaced by some other binary.

``discover`` scans a bounded set of well-known extraction directories to
SUGGEST candidates. Nothing it finds is ever executed until it has been
recorded as the configured path: CoreCycler runs as root, and silently running
a binary found in $HOME is precisely the escalation ``secure_path`` exists to
prevent.
