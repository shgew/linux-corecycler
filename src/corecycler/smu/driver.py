        The SMU addresses cores by physical slot within a CCD, counting
        fused-off cores. The kernel's /proc/cpuinfo "core id" (the APIC-ID
        decode from CPUID Fn8000_001E) is that physical numbering on most
        machines -- a fused-off core leaves a hole -- but some BIOS/AGESA
        builds renumber core ids contiguously on harvested parts instead
        (field-reported on a 5600X, issue #11), and the ids alone then hide
        which slots are fused off.

        Mapping rules, per L3 group (falling back to ``core_id // 8`` grouping
        when L3 info is absent):
          - A full 8-core group maps to identity slots under any numbering
            scheme -- no SMU traffic.
          - A group with a hole INTERNAL to its own 8-slot window proves the
            physical numbering: slot = ``core_id % 8``, CCD from L3. Only
            internal holes count -- a hole BETWEEN windows proves nothing,
            because a per-CCD-compacting firmware keeps the window stride --
            and only while every present CPU is online, because a
            fully-offlined core fakes a hole.
          - Every other harvested group is ambiguous (its slots form the
            0..n-1 prefix, it spans windows, or its holes are untrusted): the
            CCD's core-disable fuse is read over SMN and the group's cores map
            onto the live slots in ascending order (the same order-preserving
            mapping the Windows tools build from that fuse). The CO read
            cannot stand in for it -- it answers on every in-range slot,
            fused-off ones included (issue #11).
          - A fuse that cannot be read or disagrees with the OS core count stores
            ``core_map_error`` and every per-core CO operation refuses --
            failing closed beats tuning a different core than the one under
            test. While discovery runs, ``core_map_error`` holds a sentinel so
            a concurrent reader refuses rather than falling open to legacy
            addressing.

        The whole discovery is gated on the generation's declared
        ``uniform_8core_ccds`` (classic 8-slot CCD/CCX layout, verified): a
        generation without it, and any L3 group larger than 8 cores (dense
        Zen 4c/5c CCX dies), keeps the legacy core_id-derived addressing
