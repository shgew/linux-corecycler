"""Ring B (live contract) test helpers -- the never-silent skip policy.

Two tiers, because a live check can need the hardware, the privileges, or both:

    CORECYCLER_HW_CONTRACTS=1 pytest -m contract       # this machine has the hardware
    CORECYCLER_HW_PRIVILEGED=1 pytest -m contract      # and this process has the rights

Under the first, an absent hardware resource is a HARD FAILURE: a drift-check
that silently green-skips on the very machine meant to run it would hide a gap
(the owner's never-silent rule). Reading MSRs (CAP_SYS_RAWIO), dmidecode
(root) and the SMU mailbox (the corecycler group) additionally need privileges
a plain run does not hold, so those checks are fatal only under the second
flag and otherwise skip naming exactly what is uncovered -- a run without them
is still worth having. Without either variable every absent resource skips
with its reason.
