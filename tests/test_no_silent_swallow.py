"""No except may silently swallow -- it must surface the failure or say it is deliberate.

Two rules, one intent: a reader must never have to guess whether a swallowed
failure was meant to be swallowed.

1. A bare ``except:`` or ``except Exception/BaseException:`` that leaves no trace
   of the failure hides an unexpected error. A handler "surfaces" when it
   re-raises, logs, emits the error on a Qt signal, prints it, or otherwise
   references the caught exception.
2. A TYPED handler whose whole body is ``pass`` must be written as
   ``contextlib.suppress(...)``. The two forms are identical to the interpreter
   and opposite to a reader: ``suppress`` states that the failure is expected
   and acceptable, while ``except X: pass`` reads the same whether the author
   meant it or wrote the wrong type. Both real cases this rule was written for
   caught exceptions that could not occur while the reachable failure went
   unguarded, and neither was visible as anything but a normal handler.

``continue`` bodies are exempt: skipping one malformed row inside a loop is
visible from its context. A ``__del__`` finalizer is exempt because surfacing is
unsafe during interpreter shutdown.
